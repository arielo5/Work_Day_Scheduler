# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

    The motivation for this project was to create a web page that you can see your work day schedule and save what you are going to do in that work hour. The reason for this project was to apply the knowledge learn with Third-Party APIs using javascrip with jQuery and luxon. I learn that for this work there alwasys a diffent way to get the same result or shorter way to get to the same answer, you just need to look for it a make it apply it to your project in a better way. 

## Usage

    On the webpage you will see the current date and time on the head of the page and it will update the time every second to the current one. For the body you will see a row of timeblocks for standard business hours boxes with the time of your daily work from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm in the first colum, the middle colum is the test area where you will put your task for that time, and the last colum is the save button to the what is saved in the text area. The text area timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future and it will update every second. When you click the save button the information will be saved in the local storage. Lastly when the page is refresh the saved information will persist.
